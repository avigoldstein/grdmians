      <h3>General Information</h3>

      <p>
        The purpose of Grd Me is to have an easy, accessible way to encrypt text
        and use everyday communication channels to send messages in a secure way.
        You can use any messaging service to send encrypted messages to those who you have
        specifically shared your ID with, so that only they can see the decrypted
        text that you sent.
      </p>

      <h3>System Overview</h3>

      <p>
        Currently, Grd Me is compatible with Google Chrome, and the extension
        is usable on a desktop only. Because the extension is still in its development
        stage, in order to use the extension, a user must download the code from
        the Github repo and run the file from the Chrome "developer mode."
      </p>

      <h3>Getting Started</h3>
      <p>
        To get started with Grd Me, follow these steps:
      </p>

      <h4>Setting up</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Enable the Grd Me extension on Chrome
        </li>
        <li>
          Open the extension by clicking on the icon to trigger the popup box
        </li>
        <li>
          Register a name, which will be associated with you personally
        </li>
        <li>
          A unique ID will then be generated and stored in the key server, and
          this will be a one-time occurrence
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Adding contacts</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Have your intended contact send you their key by clicking the blue "Copy My Key"
          button in the extension popup
        </li>
        <li>
          Grd Me will recognize the key as a Grd Me key, and prompt you to add them
          as a contact
        </li>
        <li>
          If you are not online when a user sends you their key, they will show up
          as a pending contact in your list when you open your extension
        </li>
        <li>
          Once you've added them, you can either keep the name that they set, or you can
          change it by clicking the edit button
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h4>Messaging users</h4>
      <p>Once you've populated your contacts, you can now message those users
        using any messaging service encrypted messages, and Grd Me will automatically
        decrypt the messages for them. To do this, follow these steps:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In a text field on a messaging service (such as Facebook messenger),
          hit Ctrl/Command+e on your keyboard
        </li>
        <li>
          A textbox will pop up, and you can then type your message
        </li>
        <li>
          Press "encrypt and submit" when you have finished composing the message
        </li>
        <li>
          Your encrypted message is now copied to your clipboard - you can send it
          by pasting into the text field that you would like to use to send your
          message to
        </li>
      </ol>

      <br />

      <h4>Enabling Multi-Device</h4>
      <p>In order to enable using GrdMe across multiple devices, you must sync your GrdMe information
         through Google Chrome
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Open up settings for Google Chrome, and click on the Advanced Sync Settings button. You can either sync
          everything, or you can select what to sync (in this case be sure to have Extensions selected)
        </li>
        <li>
          when opening Chrome on another computer, make sure that you are signed in with the Chrome account
          (synonymous with a gmail account) you were signed into when originally setting up your GrdMe
        </li>
        <li>
          From there, all of your information should sync
        </li>
      </ol>

      <br />
