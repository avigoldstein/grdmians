              <p>Help! I’m not experienced with code at all but I would like to send private messages because I am
                concerned about my security and online presence. I want something that’s easy to use and that allows
                me to easily invite people to share hidden messages with.</p><br>

             <p>I am comfortable with coding, whoa this is so cool i can send encrypted messages!!</p><br>

             <p>I am at work and we need something to use to send secure and encrypted messages that is not specific to a messenger app.</p>
