            <h1>Project Concept</h1>
              <p>Our project is to continue building on Grd.me's source code to expand it's functionalities and
              make it a more viable product for any kind of user. Grd.me is an open source text encryption broswer
             extension for Chrome that enables users to send private text on any messaging platform.</p><br>

             <p>Our goals are to make Grd.me a multi-device extension, to improve it's UI experience so that both
             people with some or no experience in coding or security can use Grd.me easily and with minimal instruction,
           and to possibly use watermarks in profile pictures to associate keys with users.</p>
