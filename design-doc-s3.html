		<h2>Architecture</h2>
		This browser extension uses a server-client architecture.
		We are building off a previous project that already has implemented the
		server-client relation. We are instead working on the client side MVC, more
		specifically with the current sprint, the view of the client side. This is
		implemented using the ReactJS framework.

		<h2>Decomposition and Description</h2>
		We are implementing the <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/2e5da1ce-ebe9-4ab9-6f45-682bc047bdfe/screen/artboard1/home">client side view</a>. All implementation of client side is in place.

		<h3>Contacts Page</h3>
		The contact page shows all users that the extension has recognized, either by
		you directly adding them or getting added to a group with these users. You can
		edit their pet names and remove users.

		This view is broken down into components:
			<ul>
			 <li>ContactPage : Container of all page content/components</li>
			 <li>ContactList : Contains the list of all contacts</li>
			 <li>ContactEntry : Contains information of a single contact</li>
			</ul>
