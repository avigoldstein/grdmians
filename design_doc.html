Architecture
This browser extension uses a server-client architecture. We are building off a previous project that already has implemented the server-client relation. We are instead working on the client side MVC, more specifically with the current sprint, the view of the MVC.

Decomposition
This code is built on the pre existing code. It will be used as the view.
