<h1>Architecture</h1>
This browser extension uses a server-client architecture.
We are building off a previous project that already has implemented the
server-client relation. We are instead working on the client side MVC, more
specifically with the current sprint, the view of the client side. This is
implemented using the ReactJS framework.

<h1>Decomposition and Description</h1>
We are implementing the view of the client side. All implementation of client side is in place.

<h2>Group Page</h2>
The group page is the first page a user sees when opening the extension. You can
view all your groups, the selected group that can view your encrypted messages,
your key, and your id. You can edit any existing group in this window.

The view is broken down into components:
 - GroupPage : Container of all page content/components
 - GroupList : Contains the list of all groups
 - GroupEntry : Contains information of a single group
 - KeyInfo : Contains related info about your key

<h2>Contacts Page</h2>
The contact page shows all users that the extension has recognized, either by
you directly adding them or getting added to a group with these users. You can
edit their pet names and remove users.

This view is broken down into components:
 - ContactPage : Container of all page content/components
 - ContactList : Contains the list of all contacts
 - ContactEntry : Contains information of a single contact

<h2>New Group Page</h2>
The new group page creates a new group. This gives you the option to name the
group, and add any user from your contact list.

This view is broken down into components:
 - NewGroupPage : Container of all page content/containers
 - AddedContact : Contains the list of contacts added to the group
 - UnaddedContact : Contains the list of contacts not yet added to the group
